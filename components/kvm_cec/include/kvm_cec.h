 * The device is the sink on that cable, so on the CEC bus it is the TV: logical
 * address 0 (14 when a real TV already holds 0), physical address 0.0.0.0. It
 * answers what a TV must answer, keeps a table of who else is on the line, and
 * lets the operator put a source to sleep, wake it and press remote-control
 * keys on it.
