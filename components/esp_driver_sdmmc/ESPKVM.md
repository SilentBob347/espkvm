# ESP-KVM copy of esp_driver_sdmmc

Copied from ESP-IDF v6.1 (`components/esp_driver_sdmmc`, test apps left out).
It overrides the IDF component of the same name. Changes are marked `espkvm:`.

- `sd_trans_sdmmc.c`: reset the DMA engine before every transfer. After a failed
  transfer it stayed on a stale descriptor and the next transfer hung with no
  interrupt, which also stopped the WiFi chip on the other slot.
- `sd_trans_sdmmc.c`: a data error ends the transfer, resets the controller and
  sends CMD12, so the card leaves its receive state.
- `sd_host_sdmmc.c`: a clock update the controller does not take (it is still
  waiting for a failed transfer's data) resets the controller and is sent again
  without the wait. Before, every later command failed with 0x107.
- `sd_trans_sdmmc.c`: the DMA descriptor ring wraps at its size, not at the
  number of descriptors being refilled.

Re-check each against upstream when IDF is bumped.
