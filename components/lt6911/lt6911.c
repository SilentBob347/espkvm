 * Lontium LT6911D - the bridge on M5Stack's Add-on Display In.
 *
 * This is not a driver yet, it is a way to find out whether one is needed. The
 * chip runs its own firmware: it holds the EDID, locks to the source and decides
 * its own MIPI output without being told - a PC plugged into the add-on sees a
 * monitor before this firmware has said a word to it. So the open question is
 * whether the CSI receiver can simply be switched on and given frames.
 *
 * What is here answers that. Detect finds the chip, reads its ID out of the
 * bank-switched register space and says so in the log; the mode is declared from
 * Kconfig rather than measured, because reading it back needs register maps this
 * project does not have. Everything else a bridge can be asked to do is left out
 * - the helpers in kvm_bridge.h treat a missing operation as "nothing to do".
 *
 * The answer, on hardware, is no. The CSI receiver was set up for the mode the
 * source was sending - 720p60 and 1080p30, in RGB888 and in YUV422, at 972 and at
 * 714 Mbit/s a lane - and the MIPI output was switched on through 0xb0, which read
 * back 0x00 before and 0x01 after, so the write reaches the chip. Not one DMA
 * completion arrived in any of it.
 *
 * What programs the output is the chip's own firmware, not the host: Espressif's
 * mode "register tables" hold a single bank switch and nothing else, and their
 * driver ships an image (LT6911D_v1_default.hex) with instructions to burn it
 * first. The one in this add-on is M5Stack's, and it does not raise the lanes.
 *
 * So this file is a finding, not a driver, and it is off unless
 * CONFIG_KVM_LT6911 says otherwise - left in because the next attempt
 * starts here, and the next attempt is about firmware, not registers.
