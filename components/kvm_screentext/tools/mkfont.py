"""
Turn a character generator font into the lookup table screentext.c searches.

A text-mode screen is drawn by a character generator: every glyph is the same
bitmap every time it appears, so recognising one is a table lookup, not image
recognition. This script hashes each glyph and pairs it with the character it
stands for, which is all the scanner needs. The bitmaps themselves are never
compiled in - only the hashes - so a table costs about 2 KB whatever the font.

One table per cell height, and a table may merge several fonts: the firmwares
that draw 16-tall text do not all draw it the same way, and a bitmap is looked
up by its shape, not by which font it came from. A bitmap that means different
characters in different fonts is dropped rather than guessed at.

Three input formats, picked by extension:

  .bin  a raw ROM dump: 256 glyphs of `--height` rows, one byte per row, most
        significant bit leftmost, indexed by code page 437. What every VGA BIOS
        keeps in ROM.
  .txt  one glyph per line, `XXXX: hh hh ...`, the code point in hex followed by
        `--height` bytes. For fonts that are a list of Unicode glyphs rather
        than a code page - a UEFI firmware's font is one.
  .psf  a Linux console font, PSF1 or PSF2, gzipped or not. This is what a
        distribution actually loads into the framebuffer console, and what
        `setfont -O` writes out, so it is the way to take the font off a machine
        whose screen does not read. The Unicode table that maps each glyph to
        its character is part of the file and is required: without it the glyph
        order is the font's own business and nothing can be said about it.

    python3 tools/mkfont.py fonts/ibm_vga_8x16.bin fonts/pcdos_cp437_8x16.bin \\
        --height 16 > screentext_font_h16.h
    python3 tools/mkfont.py fonts/uefi_hii_8x19.txt --height 19 \\
        > screentext_font_h19.h

The .txt for the UEFI font is itself generated, so the chain stays reproducible:
