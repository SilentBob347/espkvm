 * H.264 into an MPEG transport stream.
 *
 * A recording is written as .ts rather than .mp4 because an MP4 keeps its index
 * at the end: pull the card or lose power and the file does not open. A
 * transport stream is a run of 188-byte packets that a player can start reading
 * anywhere, so a cut-off recording plays up to where it stopped.
 *
 * Plain C over a byte callback, so it is tested on a host.
