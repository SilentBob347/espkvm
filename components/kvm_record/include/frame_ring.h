 * Encoded frames in memory, oldest first, within a byte budget.
 *
 * One ring serves both jobs. While a recording runs it is the queue between the
 * frame reader and the card writer. While the dashcam waits for something to
 * happen it is the last minutes of the screen: when it is full the oldest
 * group of pictures goes - everything up to the next keyframe - so what is kept
 * always starts on a frame that decodes on its own.
 *
 * Plain C, no locking of its own: the caller holds a lock around every call.
